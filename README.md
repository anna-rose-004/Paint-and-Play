### 👶 Overview

Rainbow Paint is a simple, playful web game designed to help every child—especially kids with special needs—explore colors, practice number recognition, and unleash their creativity. Imagine seeing a cheerful outline of a cloud marked with a number, then choosing the matching color from a brightly labeled palette. With each correct match, soft music plays and the picture springs to life with a friendly animation.
